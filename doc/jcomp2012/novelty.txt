This work demonstrates a new iterative method for solving sparse linear
systems.  It expands on the sequential Monte Carlo method developed by Halton
to provide a fast and efficient linear solver that uses residual Monte Carlo
to accelerate fixed-point iterations.  We show that this solver is competitive
with preconditioned Conjugate Gradient when solving time-dependent, 3D
diffusion equations.

The novelty of the method is that Monte Carlo can be used to achieve
equivalent convergence as purely deterministic methods when solving linear
systems.  Additionally, this scheme is not constrained by symmetry
constraints.  Thus, we propose that this technique could perform very well on
non-symmetric, sparse systems that are traditionally solved using GMRES.
