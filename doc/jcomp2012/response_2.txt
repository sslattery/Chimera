Thank you for considering our manuscript.  We have addressed both reviewers
comments as follows:

Reviewer #2:
We have added all of the edits suggested by this reviewer.  We would also like
to thank the reviewer for a very careful reading of the manuscript.

Reviewer #3:
We have clarified the discussion at the beginning of Section 5.1:

"This maximum timestep was selected based on numerical experiments that showed
good agreement with analytic solutions of the Marshak wave problem for the
time-discretization employed in Eq. (35)."

We believe this clarifies the reviewers comments about the timestep size.  In
short, the physics of this problem requires it.  Furthermore, the reviewer's
comments are valid about larger timestep sizes requiring potentially more
powerful preconditioners, which could make the ML comparisons more
competitive.  However, the intent of the article is not to investigate or
compare linearization strategies for this problem.  We also note that
implicit, non-linearly consistent numerical approaches (e.g. JFNK) would
result in assymetric operators, thus requiring GMRES/ML instead of CG/ML.
Finally, even with fully implicit time-integration, the maximum timestep
required to resolve the wavefront speed < 1.0ns.

We hope that our modifications have met the reviewers comments.  Please
contact me if there are any further requirements.
