	abstract = {The {TOP500} is a treasure trove of information on the leading edge of high performance computing. It was used in the 2008 {DARPA} Exascale technology report to isolate out the effects of architecture and technology on high performance computing, and lay the groundwork to project how current systems might mature through the coming years. Two particular classes of architectures were identified: "heavy-weight" (based on high end commodity microprocessors) and "lightweight," (primarily {BlueGene} variants), and projections made on performance, concurrency, memory capacity, and power. This paper updates those projections, and adds a third class of "heterogeneous" architectures (leveraging the emerging class of {GPU-like} chips) to the mix.},

This paper follows up on a previous paper by the same author, in which consideration was limited to linear systems of the form Ax = a (where, again, m is large, A is a known (m√óm) matrix, a is a known m-vector, and x is an unknown m-vector). It was shown there that effective techniques could reduce computation times dramatically (speed-up factors of 550 to 26,000 were obtained in sample calculations). The methods presented here rely on the use of Newtonian linearization, combined with the {SMC} methods previously described. Incidentally, the optimization of these {SMC} methods is discussed here and should clarify the parametrization of the {SMC} techniques so as to yield the highest efficiency. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

An efficiently evaluated numerical Jacobian is used to simplify implementation, and mesh sequencing is used to increase the radius of convergence of the algorithm. We employ finite volume discretization using the power law scheme of Patankar to solve the benchmark backward facing step problem defined by the {ASME} K-12 Aerospace Heat Transfer Committee. {LINPACK} banded Gaussian elimination and the preconditioned transpose-free quasi-minimal residual {(TFQMR)} algorithm of Freund are studied as possible linear equation solvers. Implementation of the preconditioned {TFQMR} algorithm requires use of the switched evolution relaxation algorithm of Mulder and Van Leer to ensure convergence. The preconditioned {TFQMR} algorithm is more memory efficient than the direct solver, but our implementation is not as {CPU} efficient. Results show that for the level of grid refinement used, power law differencing was not adequate to yield the desired accuracy for this problem.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present an approach of reusing random walks in {M}onte {C}arlo methods for linear systems. The fundamental idea is, during the {M}onte {C}arlo sampling process, the random walks generated to estimate one unknown element can also be effectively reused to estimate the other unknowns in the solution vector. As a result, when the random walks are reused, a single random walk can contribute samples for estimations of multiple unknowns in the solution simultaneously while ensuring that the samples for the same unknown element are statistically independent. Consequently, the total number of random walk transition steps needed for estimating the overall solution vector is reduced, which improves the performance of the {M}onte {C}arlo algorithm. We apply this approach to the {M}onte {C}arlo algorithm in two linear algebra applications, including solving a system of linear equations and approximating the inversion of a matrix. Our computational results show that compared to the conventional implementations of {M}onte {C}arlo algorithms for linear systems without random walk reusing, our approach can significantly improve the performance of {M}onte {C}arlo sampling process by reducing the overall number of transition steps in random walks to obtain the entire solution within desired precision.},

Our approach is to consider algorithms first, decide what types and access operations they need for efficient execution, and regard the types and operations as formal parameters that can be instantiated in many different ways, as long as the actual parameters satisfy the assumptions on which the correctness and efficiency of the algorithms are based. The means by which instantiation is carried out is language dependent; in the C + + examples in this paper, we instantiate generic algorithms by constructing classes that define the needed types and access operations. By use of such compile-time techniques and careful attention to algorithmic issues, it is possible to construct software components of broad utility with no sacrifice of efficiency.},

	volume = {171},
	abstract = {Denovo is a new, three-dimensional, discrete ordinates {(SN)} transport code that uses state-of-the-art solution methods to obtain accurate solutions to the Boltzmann transport equation. Denovo uses the Koch-Baker-Alcouffe parallel sweep algorithm to obtain high parallel efficiency on O(100) processors on {XYZ} orthogonal meshes. As opposed to traditional {SN} codes that use source iteration, Denovo uses nonstationary Krylov methods to solve the within-group equations. Krylov methods are far more efficient than stationary schemes. Additionally, classic acceleration schemes (diffusion synthetic acceleration) do not suffer stability problems when used as a preconditioner to a Krylov solver. Denovo's generic programming framework allows multiple spatial discretization schemes and solution methodologies. Denovo currently provides diamond-difference, theta-weighted diamond-difference, linear-discontinuous finite element, trilinear-discontinuous finite element, and step characteristics spatial differencing schemes. Also, users have the option of running traditional source iteration instead of Krylov iteration. Multigroup upscatter problems can be solved using Gauss-Seidel iteration with transport, two-grid acceleration. A parallel first-collision source is also available. Denovo solutions to the Kobayashi benchmarks are in excellent agreement with published results. Parallel performance shows excellent weak scaling up to 20000 cores and good scaling up to 40000 cores.},

	abstract = {We study the application of Newton-Krylov methods for the steady-state solution of the tokamak edge plasma fluid equations. This highly nonlinear system of two-dimensional convection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equations describes the boundary layer of a tokamak fusion reactor. These equations are characterized by multiple time and spatial scales. We use Newton's method to linearize the nonlinear system of equations resulting from the implicit, finite volume discretization of the governing partial differential equations. The resulting linear systems are neither symmetric nor positive definite, and are poorly conditioned. A variety of preconditioned Krylov iterative techniques are employed to solve these linear systems, and we investigate both standard and matrix-free implementations. A number of pseudo-transient continuation methods are investigated to increase the radius of convergence. While this system of equations describes a specific application, the general algorithm should benefit other applications requiring the solution of general reacting flow type equations.},

There are many possible applications of the new algorithm, some of which are briefly discussed. In particular, a result of the flexibility of the new variant is that any iterative method can be used as a preconditioner. For example, the standard {GMRES} algorithm itself can be used as a preconditioner, as can {CGNR} (or {CGNE)}, the conjugate gradient method applied to the normal equations. However, the more appealing utilization of the method is in conjunction with relaxation techniques, possibly multilevel techniques. The possibility of changing preconditioners may be exploited to develop efficient iterative methods and to enhance robustness. A few numerical experiments are reported to illustrate this fact.},

	abstract = {Sparsified Randomization {M}onte {C}arlo {(SRMC)} algorithms for solving large systems of linear algebraic equations are presented. We construct efficient stochastic algorithms based on a probabilistic sampling of small size sub-matrices, or a randomized evaluation of a matrix-vector product and matrix iterations via a random sparsification of the matrix. This approach is beyond the standard Markov chain based {Neumann‚ÄìUlam} method which has no universal instrument to decrease the variance. Instead, in the new method, first, the variance can be decreased by increasing the number of the sampled columns of the matrix in play, and second, it is free of the restricted assumption of the {Neumann‚ÄìUlam} scheme that the Neumann series converges. We apply the developed methods to different stochastic iterative procedures. Application to boundary integral equation of the electrostatic potential theory is given where we develop a {SRMC} algorithm for solving the approximated system of linear algebraic equations, and compare it with the standard Random Walk on Boundary method. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

	abstract = {Tremendous progress has been made in the scientific and engineering disciplines regarding the use of iterative methods for linear systems. The size and complexity of linear and nonlinear systems arising in typical applications has grown, meaning that using direct solvers for the three-dimensional models of these problems is no longer effective. At the same time, parallel computing, becoming less expensive and standardized, has penetrated these application areas. Iterative methods are easier than direct solvers to implement on parallel computers but require approaches and solution algorithms that are different from classical methods. This second edition gives an in-depth, up-to-date view of practical algorithms for solving large-scale linear systems of equations, including a wide range of the best methods available today. A new chapter on multigrid techniques has been added, whilst material throughout has been updated, removed or shortened. Numerous exercises have been added, as well as an updated and expanded bibliography.},

It has been extended to support cases where the number of particles in a time step are unknown at the beginning of the time step. This situation arises when various physical processes, such as neutron transport, can generate additional particles during the time step, or when particle splitting is used for variance reduction. Additionally, several race conditions that existed in the previous algorithm and could cause code hangs have been fixed. This new algorithm is believed to be robust against all race conditions.

	abstract = {Residual {M}onte {C}arlo methods reduce statistical error at a rate of {exp(‚àíbN)}, where b is a positive constant and N is the number of particle histories. Contrast this convergence rate with , which is the rate of statistical error reduction for conventional {M}onte {C}arlo methods. Thus, residual {M}onte {C}arlo methods hold great promise for increased efficiency relative to conventional {M}onte {C}arlo methods. Previous research has shown that the application of residual {M}onte {C}arlo methods to the solution of continuum equations, such as the radiation transport equation, is problematic for all but the simplest of cases. However, the residual method readily applies to discrete systems as long as those systems are monotone, i.e., they produce positive solutions given positive sources. We develop a residual {M}onte {C}arlo method for solving a discrete {1D} non-linear thermal radiative equilibrium diffusion equation, and we compare its performance with that of the discrete conventional {M}onte {C}arlo method upon which it is based. We find that the residual method provides efficiency gains of many orders of magnitude. Part of the residual gain is due to the fact that we begin each timestep with an initial guess equal to the solution from the previous timestep. Moreover, fully consistent non-linear solutions can be obtained in a reasonable amount of time because of the effective lack of statistical noise. We conclude that the residual approach has great potential and that further research into such methods should be pursued for more general discrete and continuum systems.},

	abstract = {{M}onte {C}arlo {(MC)} linear solvers can be considered stochastic realizations of deterministic stationary iterative processes. That is, they estimate the result of a stationary iterative technique for solving linear systems. There are typically two sources of errors: (i) those from the underlying deterministic iterative process and (ii) those from the {MC} process that performs the estimation. Much progress has been made in reducing the stochastic errors of the {MC} process. However, {MC} linear solvers suffer from the drawback that, due to efficiency considerations, they are usually stochastic realizations of the Jacobi method (a diagonal splitting), which has poor convergence properties. This has limited the application of {MC} linear solvers. The main goal of this paper is to show that efficient {MC} implementations of non-diagonal splittings too are feasible, by constructing efficient implementations for one such splitting. As a secondary objective, we also derive conditions under which this scheme can perform better than {MC} Jacobi, and demonstrate this experimentally. The significance of this work lies in proposing an approach that can lead to efficient {MC} implementations of a wider variety of deterministic iterative processes.},

The first conjugate-gradient-like algorithm is the transpose-free quasi-minimal residual algorithm {(TFQMR)} and the second is the conjugate gradients squared algorithm {(CGS).} Incomplete lower-upper {(ILU)} factorization of the Jacobian matrix is used as a right preconditioner. The performance of the Newton- {TFQMR} algorithm is studied with regard to different choices for the {TFQMR} convergence criteria and the amount of fill-in allowed in the {ILU} factorization. Performance data are compared with results using the Newton-{CGS} algorithm and previous results using {LINPACK} banded Gaussian elimination (direct-Newton). The inexact Newton algorithms were found to be {CPU} competetive with the direct-Newton algorithm for the model problem considered.

For architectural designs that are in any sense extrapolations of today's, petaflops-scale computing will require approximately one-million-fold instruction-level concurrency. Given that cost-effective one thousand-fold concurrency is challenging in practical computational fluid dynamics simulations today, algorithms are among the many possible bottlenecks to {CFD} on petaflops systems. After a general outline of the problems and prospects of petaflops computing, we examine the issue of algorithms for {PDE} computations in particular, a back-of-the-envelope parallel complexity analysis focuses on the latency of global synchronization steps in the implicit algorithm. We argue that the latency of synchronization steps is a fundamental, but addressable, challenge for {PDE} computations with static data structures, which are primarily determined by grids. We provide recent results with encouraging scalability for parallel implicit Euler simulations using the Newton-Krylov-Schwarz solver in the {PETSc} software library. The prospects for {PDE} simulations with dynamically evolving data structures are far less clear.},

	abstract = {The solution of the governing steady transport equations for momentum, heat and mass transfer in flowing fluids can be very difficult. These difficulties arise from the nonlinear, coupled, nonsymmetric nature of the system of algebraic equations that results from spatial discretization of the {PDEs.} In this manuscript we focus on evaluating a proposed nonlinear solution method based on an inexact Newton method with backtracking. In this context we use a particular spatial discretization based on a pressure stabilized Petrov-Galerkin finite element formulation of the low Mach number {Navier‚ÄìStokes} equations with heat and mass transport. Our discussion considers computational efficiency, robustness and some implementation issues related to the proposed nonlinear solution scheme. Computational results are presented for several challenging {CFD} benchmark problems as well as two large scale {3D} flow simulations.},

	abstract = {Three {M}onte {C}arlo methods for matrix inversion {(MI)} and finding a solution vector of a system of linear algebraic equations {(SLAE)} are considered: with absorption, without absorption with uniform transition frequency function, and without absorption with almost optimal transition frequency function. Recently Alexandrov, Megson, and Dimov have shown that an n√ón matrix can be inverted in {3n/2+N+T} steps on a regular array with O(n2 {NT)} cells. Alexandrov and Megson have also shown that a solution vector of {SLAE} can be found in {n+N+T} steps on a regular array with the same number of cells. A number of bounds on N and T have been established {(N} is the number of chains and T is the length of the chain in the stochastic process; these are independent of n), which show that these designs are faster than existing designs for large values of n. In this paper we take another implementation approach; we consider parallel {M}onte {C}arlo algorithms for {MI} and solving {SLAE} in {MIMD} environment, e.g. running on a cluster of workstations under {PVM.} The {M}onte {C}arlo method with almost optimal frequency function performs best of the three methods; it needs about six to ten times fewer chains for the same precision.},
