\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

In many fields of engineering and physics, linear and nonlinear
problems are a primary focus of study. Recent focus on multiple
physics systems (and in particular nuclear systems) adds a new level
of complexity to common nonlinear systems as solution strategies
change when they are coupled to other problems. Furthermore, a desire
for predictive simulations to enhance the safety and performance of
engineered systems creates a need for extremely high fidelity
computations to be performed for these coupled systems as a means to
capture effects not modeled by coarser methods.

In order to achieve this high fidelity, state-of-the-art computing
facilities must be leveraged in a way that is both efficient and
considerate of hardware-related issues. As scientific computing moves
towards exascale facilities with machines of $O(1,000,000)$ cores
already coming online, new algorithms to solve these complex problems
must be developed to leverage this new hardware. Issues such as
resiliency to node failure and scaling to large numbers of cores will
be pertinent to robust algorithms aimed at this new
hardware. Considering these issues, this thesis proposes the
development of a massively parallel stochastic method for linear
problems and a novel stochastic method to advance solution techniques
for nonlinear problems.

This preliminary report oultines the conventional methods used in
practice for solving linear and nonlinear problems to provide a
mathematical basis upon which to build new algorithms that aim to
solve some of the aforementioned issues. These new algorithms will be
outlined in full with links made to past work and their potential for
offering improvements to the computational physics community. Progress
to date will be reported including the development of a new physics
framework that will serve as a test bed for these new methods that
leverages a preliminary implementation of the stochastic method. A
research plan will then be provided that continues the development and
implementation of these new methods and verifies them with benchmark
solutions, culminating in the analysis of a multiphysics simulation of
a pressurized water reactor assembly.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

For some time, the particle transport community has been utilizing
Monte Carlo methods for the solution of transport problems
\citep{lewis_computational_1993}. The partial differential equation
(PDE) community has focused on various deterministic methods for
solutions to linear problems \citep{saad_iterative_2003,
  kelley_iterative_1987}. In between these two areas are a not widely
known small group of stochastic methods for solving sparse linear
systems \citep{hammersley_monte_1964, halton_sequential_1962,
  halton_sequential__1994}. In recent years, these methods have been
further developed for transport problems in the form of Monte Carlo
Synthetic-Acceleration (MCSA)
\citep{t.m._evans__t.j._urbatsch_h._lichtenstein_j.e._morel_residual_2003,
  evans_monte_2009} but have yet to be applied to more general sparse
linear systems commonly generated by the computational physics
community. Compared to other methods in these regime, MCSA offers
three attractive qualities; (1) the linear problem operator need not
be symmetric or positive-definite, thereby reducing preconditioning
complexity, (2) the stochastic nature of the solution method provides
a natural solution to the issue of resiliency, and (3) is amenable to
parallelization using modern methods developed by the transport
community
\citep{j.c._wagner**_s.w._mosher_t.m._evans_d.e._peplow_and_j.a._turner_hybrid_2010}. The
developement of MCSA as a general linear solver and the development of
a parallel MCSA method will be new and unique features of this
work. Resiliency will not be addressed.

In addition to linear solver advancements, nonlinear solvers may also
benefit from a general and parallel MCSA scheme. In the engineering
community, nonlinear problems are often addressed by either
linearizing the problem or building a segregated scheme and using
traditionaly iterative or direct methods to solve the resulting system
\citep{pletcher_computational_1997}. In the mathematics community,
various Newton methods have been popular
\citep{kelley_iterative_1987}. Recently, Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov
(JFNK) schemes \citep{knoll_jacobian-free_2004} have been utilized in
multiple physics architectures and advanced single physics codes
\citep{gaston_parallel_2009}. The benefits of JFNK schemes are that the
Jacobian is never formed, simplifying the implementation, and a Krylov
solver is leveraged (typically GMRES or Conjugate Gradient), providing
excellent convergence properties for well-conditioned and well-scaled
systems. However, there are two potential drawbacks to these methods
for high fidelity predictive simulations: (1) the Jacobian is
approximated by a first-order differencing method on the order of
machine precision such that this error can grow beyond that of those
in a fine-grained system and (2) for systems that are not symmetric
positive-definite (which will be the case for most multiphysics
systems and certainly for most preconditioned systems) the Krylov
subspace generated by the GMRES solver may become prohibitively
large. To address these issues, this thesis proposes a new and novel
method for nonlinear systems based on the MCSA method.

The Forward-Automated Newton-MCSA (FANM) method is proposed as new
nonlinear solution method. The key features of FANM are: full Jacobian
generation using modern Forward Automated Differencing (FAD) methods
\citep{hutchison_automatic_2006}, and MCSA as the inner linear
solver. This method has several attractive properties. First, the
first-order approximation to the Jacobian used in JFNK type methods is
eliminated by generating the Jacobian explicitly with the model
equations through FAD. Second, the Jacobian need not be explicitly
formed by the user but is instead automated through FAD; this
eleminates the complexity of hand-coding derivatives and has also been
demonstrated to be more efficient computationally than evaluating
differenced derivatives \citep{hutchison_automatic_2006}. Third,
unlike GMRES, MCSA does not build a subspace during
iterations. Although the Jacobian must be explicitly formed to use
MCSA, for problems that take more than a few GMRES iterations to
converge the size of the Krylov subspace will grow beyond that of the
Jacobian. Finally, using MCSA for the linear solve provides its
benefits for preconditioning, potential resiliency, and parallelism.
