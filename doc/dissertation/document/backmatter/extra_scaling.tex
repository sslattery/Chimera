\chapter{Subdomain Neumann-Ulam Scaling with Multiple Sets}
\label{chap:extra_scaling}
As an additional analysis of MCSA using subdomain Monte Carlo, the multiple
sets scaling studies are repeated to determine if any performance
benefits are made from replication by eliminating Monte Carlo
communication. Figure~\ref{fig:titan_strong_subdomain_ms_time} gives
the runtimes for the strong scaling calculation and
Figure~\ref{fig:titan_strong_subdomain_ms} the computed absolute
efficiencies. For the weak scaling studies,
Figure~\ref{fig:titan_weak_subdomain_ms_time} gives the wall times and
Figure~\ref{fig:titan_weak_subdomain_ms} the efficiencies. For both
scaling studies, the results are effectively the same as for the case
with Monte Carlo communication. This is again due to the fact that
adding sets to the problem is not only an exercise in strong scaling
but it also adds additional parallel overhead in the form of the tally
vector reduction across blocks.

From a parallel performance perspective, MCSA may then be best used in
a mode where the Monte Carlo is performed over only the subdomains
with no replication or overlap added to the system. In this mode,
iterative performance is maintained relative to the solutions with
communication even for more ill-conditioned problems with larger
spectral radii. Furthermore, no overlap was required to maintain
iterative performance be letting histories near the boundary take a
few more steps in their random walks. If in the future there are
ill-conditioned problems where using subdomain Monte Carlo reduces the
algorithmic efficiency of MCSA due to the information lost in the
correction vector, overlap would be a viable mechanism to potentially
maintain that iterative performance, keeping in mind the potential
impacts on scalability that were observed in this work. However,
although eliminating all Monte Carlo communication was observed to be
the best mode of use for MCSA, the parallel Monte Carlo methods
developed for this work still provide value for cases where only a
Monte Carlo solution is desired. In those cases, full transport of the
Monte Carlo histories are required in order to generate the correct
solution.
