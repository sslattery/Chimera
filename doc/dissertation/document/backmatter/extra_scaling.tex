\chapter{Subdomain Neumann-Ulam Scaling with Multiple Sets\ }
\label{chap:extra_scaling}
As an additional analysis of MCSA using subdomain Monte Carlo, the multiple
sets scaling studies are repeated to determine if any performance
benefits are made from replication by eliminating Monte Carlo
communication. Figure~\ref{fig:titan_strong_subdomain_ms_time} gives
the runtimes for the strong scaling calculation and
Figure~\ref{fig:titan_strong_subdomain_ms} the computed absolute
efficiencies. For the weak scaling studies,
Figure~\ref{fig:titan_weak_subdomain_ms_time} gives the wall times and
Figure~\ref{fig:titan_weak_subdomain_ms} the efficiencies. For both
scaling studies, the results are effectively the same as for the case
with Monte Carlo communication. This is again due to the fact that
adding sets to the problem is not only an exercise in strong scaling
but it also adds additional parallel overhead in the form of the tally
vector reduction across blocks.
